A Chinese reader and translator loving European history stories in middle ages, especially in late 13th century around the Mediterranean.

Now is translating *History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages(en)* by **Ferdinand Gregorovius**, and finished *Geschichte Konradins von Hohenstaufen(de)* by **Karl Hampe**.

A fan of Holy Roman Empire.

Enthusiast of Italian commune state.

Nowadays AI have do a great help to language auto-translating, but it still has many shortages, especially between a different language family. Chinese is particular, even though in the same Sino-Tibetan, it has great differences from Tibetan, so we still need human doing.

# Why to be a translator

When I came to read Norman Douglas' famous *Old Calabria*, I found it obscure to understand a lot of author's meanings. The names **Conradin**, **Charles**, **Manfred** and even **Palaeologus** arose my great curiosity, I was eager to know what had happened about 750 years ago, though I felt confident in world history comparing to most of my contemporaries. Conradin, whose tragic fate attracted me, was the most one I would like to know, then Manfred, his heroic death and his children's miserable imprison deeply touch my heart, I knew Dante wrote him in his great *Divine Comedy*, but I never had such a curiosity until his name appeared in front of me as a real person in history.

I came to find that there were so few readings in Chinese about a history of that time until I began to learn more. Thanks to excellent details and references of English and German wiki, I gradually setup history timeline and event relationships, nearly a month later! It involved so many stories, persons, and countriesï¼Œand even more stories, persons behind them! More I learned, more I found, so many books had no Chinese translation, even many were never heard of in Chinese world.

In china, tens of thousands of books about Renaissance were introduced, but Renaissance eve were so few! Kings of England had been defeated by barons, their powers were greatly weaken; Interregnum would open the rule of Habsburg to Holy Roman Empire, an elective monarchy never conceivable by Chinese people; Italian communes were giving birth to Renaissance and modern democracy. Also this history gave me a new picture of history telling: it should contain vivid details, immersive dialog rather than event listings, influence summaries, and it taught me more to realise the importance of Dante and his great works. So many events and people were spreaded and popular due to his marvelous writing, but in an obscure, magic-miracle form. One could hardly deeply understand it if he/she had not enough historical base. Experts definitely did us a favor to comment or note history backgrounds, but we still need more details, details of real characters and personalities! It would be a great loss if these stories were buried in history dust, those stories should be more talked by more people in the world. That is what I would love to do.

But how hard to make a book into print in this country! The root sin is publishing censorship and ISBN monopoly, and private publishing paper books were to sentenced to a crime. Here exists a strange situation: press were owned by the state, but they would have to sell their print to market. Multi-Volume books were great risk to them, and they love to pursue commercial success and just publish modern, popular best sellings. Medieval subject and content were not popular in this asia, continent country, people in this ages were few studied, and were considered unimportant. One have to cost a lot money to buy the subject and content they had no interest in, to make them into print. Many translators, loving to popularize, but could not afford.

# What I did

With enthusiasm, I finished translation of Conradin's biography, wroten by Karl Hampe, but found no press is willing to publish, I was told "the market would be silent", hope one day this book came out through buying :). And also finished **Conradin part** of *History of the City of Rome in the Middle Ages*.

I use `Markdown` to write articles, and use `gitbook` to manage and published on the internet through [gitlab](https://conradin.gitlab.io/conradin), besides Chinese, I collected its German origin and also make it into markdown format, the English version were totally translated by AI, most by *google translate*, a little by *deepl*.

Too many bugs existing in gitbook and its stopping development, made me decide to write my own manage tools *dartbook*, which was implemented by `dart` programming lanague. It mainly target in smooth migration from gitbook. I came to find that there already were an alternative to gitbook several days ago, its name is honkit, but many bugs since gitbook were also kept, while mine was more fast and less bugs.

Markdown library of dart language did not support footnote, which is a great feature to article writings, so I submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/dart-lang/markdown/pull/441) to it, but still in progress.

I also have a lot of ideas about article writing tools, improvement of functions, new feature for translating, e.g. I Hardly complete them while make a living at the same time, it definitely would be a great help to make an earning through these work.
